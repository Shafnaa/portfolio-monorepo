I'm currently exploring my potential at Apple Developer Academy @ UCS. I graduated with Electrical Engineering from Universitas Jenderal Soedirman. I strongly believe that understanding how things work is important, without it success is often just luck.

I started building at 14, beginning with an Arduino ultrasonic ruler. Since then, I've continued exploring different domains and technologies.

My core areas include:
- Web Development (FastAPI, React)
- Mobile Development (Swift, React Native)
- Embedded Systems (Arduino, IoT)

I'm passionate about technology that solves small things in our daily lives that others overlooked. It actually started when I got my first iPhone and when I change my background it automatically split my picture into two layer for aesthetic lock screen. Since then, I've been deeply interested in on-device AI/ML technology, especially within the Apple Ecosystem.

Beyond software, I'm particularly interested in Smart Home solutions. Because not only lives on the Software Realms, but also able to interact with our real worlds and helps us on physical daily tasks. Also, I LOVE beautiful interior design & architecture.

On the side I'm a Chess addict (1400 ELO @ chess.com), Goddess Rockstar, and die-hard Timothy Ronald fans.

I'm always open to learning, building, and collaborating on meaningful projects."""
